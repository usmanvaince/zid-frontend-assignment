## Project setup

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve

#### Note
```
As stripe is not available in Pakistan, although I have worked a lot with stripe on both front-end and back-end 
but I can't share the api keys. So I have not integrated the stripe. However, if we have to work on the real project we can easily integrate stripe elements into our forms.
